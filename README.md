# numguess
Simple command line number guessing game written in Python.

# Features
- After each game, the program asks if you would like to play again. The program will not stop until you enter 'N' or 'n'.
- When the number is guesses correctly, it will tell you how many guesses it took, and if that was your best try so far.
- Calculates and keeps track of a few statistics, such as which game was the user's best attempt and the average number of guesses per game.
